This repo is the master repo for my AWS playground and contains submodules to
all the repos I have made for it.

To create a service account for Argo in any cluster just simply set your kubectl
context to the cluster you want to create the service account for and run
~create-argocd-token.sh~.

To undo this run ~destroy-argocd-token.sh~.
